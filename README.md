Hi, welcome to the team. I’m so glad you are here at HomeAway and joining the Development Tools Engineering team (we call it DevTools in short).

It’s going to take a solid quarter to figure this place out. I understand the importance of first impressions, and I know you want to get a check in the win column, but this is a complex place full of equally complex humans. Take your time, meet everyone, go to every meeting, write things down, and ask all the questions – especially about all those baffling acronyms and emoji.

One of the working relationships we need to define is ours. The following is a user guide for me and how I work. It captures what you can expect out of the average week, how I like to work, my north star principles, and some of my, uh, nuance. My intent is to accelerate our working relationship with this document.

## Our Average Week

We’ll have a 1:1 every other week for at least 30 minutes no matter what. This meeting discusses topics of substance, not updates. I’ve want to use Slack direct message(DM) for the two us of to capture future topics for our 1:1s. When you or I think of a topic, we dump it in that channel.

We’ll have a all-hands/retrospective meeting with your peers every other week for 60 minutes no matter what. Unlike 1:1s, we have a shared document which captures agenda topics for the entire team. Similar to 1:1s, we aren’t discussing status at this meeting, but issues of substance that affect the whole team.

You can Slack or email me 24 hours a day. I like responding quickly.

If I am traveling, I will give you notice of said travel in advance. All our meetings still occur albeit with time zone considerations.

I work a bit on the weekends. This is my choice. **I do not expect that you are going to work on the weekend.** I might Slack you things, but unless the thing says URGENT, it can always wait until work begins for you on Monday.

## North Star Principles

**Humans first.** I believe that happy, informed, and productive humans build fantastic product. I optimize for the humans. Most other leaders will maximize the business, the technology, or any other number of important facets. Ideological diversity is key to an effective team. All perspectives are relevant, and we need all these leaders, but my bias is towards building productive humans.

**It is important to me that humans are treated fairly.** I believe that most humans are trying to to do the right thing, but unconscious bias leads them astray. I work hard to understand and address my biases because I understand their ability to create inequity. In any doubt or concern, I will be here to help you.

**Leadership comes from everywhere.**  I’ve wasted a lot of time in poorly run meetings by bad managers. As an engineer, I remain skeptical of managers even as a manager. While I believe managers are an essential part of a scaling organization, I don’t believe they have a monopoly on leadership, and I work hard to build other constructs and opportunities in our teams for non-managers to lead.

**I try to automate everything and focus on real challanges .** I reduce all complex things into systems and try to automate them. I take great joy in attempting to understand how these systems and flowcharts all fit together and finally automate them so that I can focus on things that matter, instead of repeating "me too"s. When I see large or small inefficiencies in systems, I’d like to fix them with your help.

**I believe in the compounding awesomeness of continually fixing small things.** Albert Einstein once said compounding [interest] is the most powerful force in the universe. I believe quality assurance is everyone’s responsibility and there are bugs to be fixed everywhere… all the time. I suggest you to take a look at the famous [Broken windows theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory) which goes hand in hand with fixing small things fast.

**I have tendency to architect things, and I shouldn't.** I worked as a software engineer and architect before and I still have the urge to architect things, even though that's not my job and there are folks in this company with the title "architect" to do it for living and do it better. Feel free to remind me if I get into the architecture, I'm still trying to fix this habbit.  

**I heavily bias towards action.** Long meetings where we are endlessly debating potential directions are often valuable, but I believe starting is the best way to begin learning and make progress. This is not always the correct strategy. This strategy annoys those who like to debate. I prefer to get something small but working out there to test things out and receive early feedback, instead of "death by committee" converations.

## My Job

1. Attract and Retain World-Class Talent (that's you)
2. Set context

And there's no #3. 

- If I do something that negatively impacts my ability to retain you, you would be doing me a huge favor if you let me know about it, as soon as possible. 

- If I do something that feels more like telling you how to do your job than setting context, you'd be doing me a huge favor if you let me know about it, as soon as possible

## Feedback Protocol

I firmly believe that feedback is at the core of building trust and respect in a team.

At HomeAway, we have a continous feedback cycle. I will make sure to provide you both positive and negative feedback and propose set of goals for you. These are not product or technology goals; these are professional growth goals for you.

In our face-to-face meeting, we’ll discuss and agree on your goals for the next period, and I’ll ask for feedback on my performance and "what can I do better?". At our following review, the process differs thusly: I’ll review you against our prior goals, and I’ll introduce new goals (if necessary). Rinse and repeat.

Reviews are not the only time we’ll exchange feedback. This will be a recurring topic in our 1:1s. I am going to ask you for feedback in 1:1s regularly. I am never going to stop doing this no matter how many times you say you have no feedback for me.

Disagreement is feedback and the sooner we learn how to efficiently disagree with each other, the sooner we’ll trust and respect each other more. Ideas don’t get better with agreement. 

## Meeting Protocol

I go to a lot of meetings. I deliberately run with my calendar publicly visible. If you have a question about a meeting on my calendar, ask me. If a meeting is private or confidential, it’s title and attendees will be hidden from your view. The vast majority of my meetings are neither private nor confidential.

My definition of a meeting includes an agenda and/or intended purpose, the appropriate amount of productive attendees, and a responsible party running the meeting to a schedule. If I am attending a meeting, I’d prefer starting on time. If I am running a meeting, I will start that meeting on time.

If you send me a presentation deck or meeting update in a reasonable amount of time before a meeting, I will read it before the meeting and will have my questions at the ready. If I haven’t read it, I will tell you.

If a meeting completes its intended purpose before it’s scheduled to end, let’s give the time back to everyone. If it’s clear the intended goal won’t be achieved in the allotted time, let’s stop the meeting before time is up and determine how to finish the meeting later.
